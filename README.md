## Gameplay

Species fears have become the main disaster for all the worlds that exist in the universe. Especially, it was hard for people to control their fears. Also, the magic world had devastative attacks by their imagination and their fears. 

Fears absorbing all the species from inside making them miserable, helpless, and unhappy. All children live only in fear. 

All the fears are controlled by the Thing. He could read minds, make the inception of nightmares, and the saddest thoughts about everything in the universe. What's more, all these thoughts are becoming real. 

Even all the united power of the mages and a lot of different species could not conquer the Thing. Species live like in a dark cloudy world where everything is connected with the pain and depression. 

The Thing has three servants: The Zombie Pumpkin, Dragon, and Big Cat.

Many years there were no heroes to conquer the Thing and his servants. However, some rebels learnt to control their fears and imaginations, to alter the thoughts for the Thing. The most powerful resistance was shown by the human born boy called Warrior and the Mage from the magic world. And they started hunting for the servants of the Thing...
